            <br> 1. Regarding the first question about the Netflix data, my dashboard shows the number of titles per genre using a 
            horizontal bar graph. It's possible to see all genres included in the original dataframe on the y-axis of the bar graph,
            and the number of titles associated with that genre on the x-axis of the bar graph. Additionally, the original data 
            classified a single title as a number of different genres. I considered each genre a title was associated 
            with, and incremented each genre by 1 after splitting the "listed_in" column and identifying each included genre. 
            In order to answer the second question, I created a line graph with release year on the x-axis and the average runtime
            on the y-axis. I did this through first eliminating all the TV-Shows from the data and grouping all remaining movies 
            according to the year they were released. I then summed up all durations of movies released in a specific year, and 
            divided the sum by the number of titles released in that specific year to obtain the average. Lastly, to answer
            the third question, I created a bar chart showing each director-actor pair on the y-axis and the number of movies 
            a specific pair was included in on the x-axis. I achieved this by first identifying each director-actor movie per movie
            for all movies and storing their count in a dictionary. As a result, I believe my dashboard does an effective job 
            of showing and visualizing the requested data. <br> 
            <br> 2. The first reason d3 was helpful and improved my visualization is that it was very easy to quickly see my graphs on
            the web using my browser and also print out some parts of my code using the console. Thus, d3 allowed me to see 
            the end products of my code on my browser by allowing for live updates, which was extremely helpful, both for visualizing
            and debugging. Another reason d3 was helpful is because of its flexibility. D3 works very well with a number of existing 
            web technologies, including but not limited to HTML, SVG, and CSS. It also works with the built-in technologies from browsers
            to allow for mouse interaction. Therefore, d3 is very user-friendly and isn't limited to only a few web technology stacks. 
            Finally, d3 can be used to create a variety of graphs that can be coded to look anything like the developer wants. Even 
            though I only created 2 different types of graphs (bar and line graph), d3 can be used to create much more advanced 
            and complicated graphs with extra features, such as filters, toggles, and tooltips. Through its extensive offerings 
            and its allowence for creativity, d3 stands out among other similar libraries.  <br> 
            <br> 3. One downside of using d3 is that d3 doesn't support some older versions of browsers, such as Internet Explorer 8.
            Therefore, when trying to load and see the data, some users may experience difficulty as d3 won't be compatible with 
            the browsers they're using. Additionally, d3 can be very time consuming to use when compared with other data visualization
            libraries, such as matplotlib in Python. Because matplotlib has several functions that are very easy to learn and use, 
            d3 can be inefficient to use in some cases, even though it can create much more detailed and advanced graphs. Finally, d3 
            may not be the best library to use when working with large quantities of data, since SVG has some limitations to its 
            performance when dealing with larger datasets. <br> 
            <br> 4. My dashboard may not be accessible to users with visual impairments. More importantly, for people with blindness,
            none of the information presented in my graphs is accessible. Therefore, it's important to use assistive 
            technology to make dashboards more accessible to people with this condition. We can add a text description for each 
            graph included in the dashboard, which concisely but comprehensively explains the information the graph aims to 
            visualize. Then, using a screen reader, everyone can have an understanding of the visualized data. Additionally, 
            we should be careful with using the colors red and green in a single graph to represent different categories as this 
            can cause people with color blindness to struggle. After reading the article, “Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of 
            Data Visualization,” and its section on color-blindess, I realized that I was using both colors in my dashboard when 
            visualizing my data, which helped me become more aware about this issue. Last but not least, we should also be careful
            about using some animations that include a sudden change in colors and shapes, as this can trigger epilepsy, ADHD, or
            other cognitive abilities. For example, while including a button on dashboards to change colors of graphs is fine, designing 
            a graph that automatically changes colors can be too risky. <br> 
            <br> 5. When designing my dashboard, I could include sound descriptions for each graph that would convey a brief summary  
            about the data the graphs are aiming to describe for people with visual impairments. I think two factors that caused me to 
            neglect including sound on my dashboard was my lack of awareness and the technical difficulties regarding accomplishing 
            this. After learning about how my dashboard can be inaccesible to some people, I became more aware of this issue and will 
            make sure to do more research on how to use the d3 library to include sound buttons on dashboards.
